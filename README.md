# Sorting "random words" with Many-core Engine for Perl

It is March of 2014. A group of folks at work have decided to work on
a sorting challenge just for fun. I am the author of a Perl module named
Many-core Engine (MCE) and wanted to see if MCE can benefit sorting.

   http://code.google.com/p/many-core-engine-perl/

My homework was mr-merge.cc for our team challenge. Although faster than
the unix sort binary, I wanted faster and searched the web.

One of the links pointed me to the multikey quicksort implementation by
Bentley and Sedgewick. [1] That performs quite well and is faster than
mr-merge. However, I wondered if sorting could go even faster and
searched again. My search ended at this amazing site by Timo Bingmann.

   http://panthema.net/2013/parallel-string-sorting/

My goal was nothing more than to take several fast sequential algorithms
and parallelize using the MCE Perl module. I began with bs-mkqs which is
using 7-bit versus 8-bit for the array type. So, I normalized on using
7-bit for all the examples. The number of keys in the radix implementations
were changed from 256 to 128 as well.

## Directory content

```
  .Inline/   The Perl Inline module creates this directory. Any changes made
             to the embedded C code will cause a small delay when running the
             first time. This is due to Inline compiling C and caching to
             this directory.

  bin/       bs-mkqs, mr-merge, ng-cradix, tb-radix, tr-radix

             mce-sort1 :  95 buckets
             mce-sort2 : 189 buckets (double)

             Each bucket requires a file handle during the pre-sorting stage.

  lib/       Perl modules MCE, Inline, Parse::RecDescent (needed by Inline), 
             and CpuAffinity.

  src/       bs-mkqs.cc, mr-merge.cc, ng-cradix.cc, tb-radix.cc, tr-radix.cc,
             main.h, and the Makefile.
```
      
## Usage

Required Perl modules under CentOS/RedHat.

```
  yum install perl-ExtUtils-MakeMaker
  yum install perl-Time-HiRes  (not included with Perl 5.8.x)
```

Inline and Parse::RecDescent modules are included under the lib dir and
not necessary to install.

Compile the sources.

```
  cd src; make clean; make; cd ../bin
```

Running.

```
  $ ./bs-mkqs [-r] FILE > sorted               ## Compute using 1 core

  $ ./mce-sort1 -e bs-mkqs [-r] FILE > sorted  ## Compute using many cores

  $ ./mce-sort1

  NAME
     mce-sort1 -- wrapper script for parallelizing sort binaries

  SYNOPSIS
     mce-sort1 [options] -e SORTEXE [-r] FILE

  DESCRIPTION
     The mce-sort1 script utilizes MCE to sort FILE in parallel.
     The partition logic is suited for string sorting as of this time.

     The following options are available:

     --maxworkers=<val> Specify the number of workers for MCE (default auto)
     --parallelio       Enable parallel IO for stage A partitioning of data

     --bm               Display benchmark info
     --check            Check array after sorted
     --no-output        Omit sorted output

     -e SORTEXE         Specify the sort command
     -r                 Reverse output order

  EXAMPLES
     mce-sort1 --maxworkers=8 --bm --check --no-output -e tr-radix ascii.4gb
     mce-sort1 --maxworkers=4 -e tr-radix ascii.4gb > sorted.4gb
```

## Description of sequential algorithms

```
  mr-merge.cc    Merge sort implementation (my challenge assignment)

  bs-mkqs.cc     Multikey quicksort by Bentley and Sedgewick [1]
  ng-cradix.cc   Cache efficient radix sort by Waihong Ng    [2]
  tb-radix.cc    Radix sort implementation by Timo Bingmann  [3]
  tr-radix.cc    8-bit in-place radix sort by Tommi Rantala  [4]

## Testing

Obtain the 1 GB Random test file from below URL and extract to /dev/shm/.
http://panthema.net/2013/parallel-string-sorting/

Create a 32gb file. Change 32 to a smaller number. Ensure at least 60%
available space before running. The following will create a 32gb file
containing over 3.27 billion strings.

```
  cd /dev/shm

  for s in `seq 1 32`; do
     cat random.1073741824 >> random.ascii.32gb
  done
```

Are you running on a system with many CPU sockets? Use numactl to have
memory allocated evenly across all CPU nodes. Check with numactl -H.

```
  RedHat/CentOS:  sudo yum install numactl
  Ubuntu:         sudo apt-get install numactl

  cd /dev/shm

  for s in `seq 1 32`; do
     numactl -i all cat random.1073741824 >> random.ascii.32gb
  done

  numactl -H
```

## Sorting

The sorting process is done in 3 stages. Inline C is used to handle
pre-sorting. CPU affinity is applied under the Linux environment.

```
  A. Partition (fast 1 character pre-sorting into individual buckets)
  B. Sequential sorting (choose an algorithm of your liking)
  C. Serialize output (runs alongside Stage B)
```

The pre-sorting logic is suited for string sorting only. No attempt was made
to sort a file having the same first character for every line. So, not useful
in that regard. The challenge was sorting a file having many random words.

## Absolute run time in seconds

The system is a dual Intel Xeon E5-2660 (v1), 1600 MHz 128GB, running
Fedora 20 x86_64. The box has 16 real cores (32 logical PEs).

Running with 1 core takes 405.848 seconds to sort the pointer array.
Interestingly enough is that it takes 357.870 seconds with mce-sort1.
The pre-sorting stage creates up to 95 partitions which are sorted
individually afterwards.

```
  $ ./tr-radix --bm --check --no-output /dev/shm/random.ascii.32gb

  LOAD:   13.137478      load into memory
  PTRA:   56.706502      fill pointer array
  SORT:  405.848093      sort pointer array
  CHKA:  168.436225      check sorted
  SAVE:    0.000000      0 due to passing --no-output
  FREE:    1.167123      free memory
  PASS:    1             check succeeded, used by MCE

  $ ./mce-sort1 --maxworkers=1 --bm --check --no-output \
       -e tr-radix /dev/shm/random.ascii.32gb 

  pre-sort         :  131.124s
  load partitions  :   13.876s
  fill ptr arrays  :   54.972s
  sort ptr arrays  :  226.746s + 131.124s (pre-sort) = 357.870s
  check sorted     :  144.040s
  free memory      :    1.376s
```

Compare 405.848 seconds (1 core) with 27.462 seconds (16 cores) for
mce-sort1 -e tr-radix. That is quite good considering the later also
includes the pre-sorting time.

Thank you to the folks whom have contributed fast sorting algorithms to
the world. Fast sequential algorithms can be parallelized with mce-sort1
(string sorting currently).
